# MediServices
The MediServices is a web application designed to facilitate the donation of medicines to needy people. It aims to connect donors with surplus or unused medicines to individuals who require them but may not have the means to access or afford them. This project was created with the purpose of making a positive impact on society by ensuring that essential medications reach those who need them the most.
